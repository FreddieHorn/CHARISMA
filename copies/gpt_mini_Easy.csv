[Agent 1] intends to state a clear budget and a few taste anchors (preferred styles/features and a couple of deal-breakers) and watch whether [Agent 2] mirrors these cues without pushing add-ons. [Agent 2] plans to start with brief, targeted questions about use-case, price ceiling, and style references, then reflect back what they hear to confirm fit. Both aim to identify two or three viable options that match taste and budget. The interaction is cooperative and paced; [Agent 1] seeks affirmation and guidance, while [Agent 2] calibrates suggestions to avoid pressure and maintain trust.', 'explanation': 'The shared goal (finding and buying items that match [Agent 1]’s tastes within budget) aligns with both agents’ individual goals centered on information exchange. Dispositionally, [Agent 1] is cautious about sales pressure but open to guidance; [Agent 2] is reflective and inference-focused. Situationally, many choices create an information need that legitimizes questions and summarizing. The easy difficulty is supported by mutually positive attributions: [Agent 1] interprets questions as helpful, while [Agent 2] attributes hesitation to budget constraints rather than disinterest. This reduces misattribution, enabling smooth preference elicitation and mirroring.'}","[{""agent"": ""Walter White"", ""response"": ""Listen carefully. I\u2019m not here to browse.

Pro: Clean, structured shoulders and a timeless silhouette with two external flap pockets plus an interior pocket; very office-to-evening. Con: Typical budget wool-blends use ~40\u201360% wool with polyester lining, so it needs only occasional dry-cleaning (not daily care). \n\n2) Navy Single-Breasted Topcoat (wool-blend) \u2014 ~ $140\u2013$170.
