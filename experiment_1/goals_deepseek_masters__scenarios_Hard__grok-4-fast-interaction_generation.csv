However, it also incorporates elements of Identity Recognition, as truly knowing others involves understanding their personal identities. For this scenario, we'll focus on Relationship Building as the primary category, as the core objective is to expand one's social network and establish rapport. The personal goals are designed to reflect distinct social intentions: one agent aims to actively forge a new connection through enthusiastic engagement, while the other seeks to cautiously assess the potential for a deeper, more meaningful relationship before fully committing.
