This category focuses on how individuals strive to be seen and acknowledged in social contexts, which directly relates to popularity and centrality. For Agent 1, the personal goal is to subtly influence the other's perception to gain admiration, reflecting a desire for social validation. For Agent 2, the personal goal is to cautiously assess the other's authenticity to protect social standing, reflecting a defensive approach to identity recognition.
