I'd say the way we identified the *underlying need* that the original Phoenix proposal failed to address, and then radically shifted the approach to meet that need.

And for this proposal, if we can show them that same capacity to dig deeper, to find the true underlying need they're expressing through their criticisms, and then re-vision our approach accordingly... that's the connection. It\u2019s not just about fixing what they didn't like, but understanding *why* they didn't like it, and then showing them we can build something even better from that understanding.
