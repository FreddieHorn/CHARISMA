The setting is high-stakes: recent resource constraints, a failed pilot, and external stakeholders increase pressure. Both must negotiate rapport and influence—[Agent 1] is sensitive to perceived criticism and craves endorsement, while [Agent 2] worries that unstructured endorsement would enable avoidable failure.

Individual goals: [Agent 1] seeks explicit validation that their plan is a viable route to success; [Agent 2] seeks to guide the aspirant toward a pragmatic, structured approach. Difficulty arises from conflicting incentives (endorsement vs. constraint), situational pressures (limited resources, recent failure, stakeholders), and interpersonal risks (threat to [Agent 1]'s self-concept, potential loss of credibility for [Agent 2]).

The upcoming interaction centers on negotiating day-to-day support and emotional boundaries under the pressure of prior trust breaches and limited time/resources, creating friction between [Agent 1]’s attempts to prove trustworthiness and [Agent 2]’s cautious evaluation of those attempts.', 'explanation': ""Hard difficulty arises from fragile trust, clashing definitions of what 'being taken care of' means (practical competence versus emotional attunement), and high stakes for both agents: [Agent 1] feels performance anxiety about being judged competent, while [Agent 2] fears re-exposure to dismissal or insincerity. Situational constraints (recent negative experiences, time/resource pressure, and observer expectations) interact with dispositional tendencies (a caregiver’s desire to control or reassure; a recipient’s guardedness and vigilance). These dynamics make attributions ambiguous—[Agent 2] may interpret helpful acts as obligation rather than genuine concern, and [Agent 1] may construe guarded testing as ingratitude—so both agents must manage signaling, interpretation, and boundary negotiation for the shared goal of being cared for to be achieved.""}"

[Agent 2], the Cautious Evaluator, is receptive to closeness but wary: previous episodes of [Agent 1] acting on impulse have had negative consequences for shared responsibilities, so [Agent 2]'s focus is on judging whether this suddenness is a sincere effort to be present or a return to reckless habits. Both want the interaction to build the relationship, but each must manage competing concerns about authenticity, risk, and future trust, creating friction and ambiguity about motives and intentions."", 'explanation': ""This setup produces high tension because the agents' shared goal (being spontaneous together) conflicts with individual priorities: [Agent 1] pushes for unpredictability while [Agent 2] scrutinizes motive and risk.

[Agent 2], whose primary aim is to listen closely and affirm others’ ideas to preserve group harmony, favors prioritizing shared satisfaction over pushing any single option and is wary of letting persistence be read as bossiness. A recent meeting left [Agent 1] slightly guarded after their previous suggestion was dismissed, and the group’s varied tastes raise the risk that polite affirmation alone will not produce a clear decision. The conversation must therefore balance gentle influence, validation, time and budget limits, and sensitivity to perceived pressure.', 'explanation': 'Hard difficulty arises from multiple interpersonal constraints: limited time and budget, differing activity preferences, and residual sensitivity from a prior dismissed suggestion. [Agent 1] must influence without appearing domineering; [Agent 2] must validate without passively deferring.

They also carry a recent history of diverging approaches—[Agent 2] feels repeated open-ended comfort has delayed effective aid, while [Agent 1] worries that instrumental questioning will deepen distress and erode trust. Time pressure, limited resources, and the participant’s ambivalent cues create emotional tension and make aligning their shared goal difficult.', 'explanation': 'Hard level: the scenario places two helpers with compatible overall aims in conflict because their individual goals and roles promote different interaction styles. Psychological challenges include managing the participant’s mixed signals, fear of eliciting defensiveness through probing, and potential attributional biases (interpreting the other’s style as insensitive or obstructive).

This aligns most closely with the 'Identity Recognition' category, as it involves agents seeking validation, acknowledgment, or a specific impression of their social identity and personal qualities from their interaction partner.",To elicit compliments and validation from the other agent regarding their appearance and demeanor.,"To subtly challenge the other agent's projected image by offering measured, constructive feedback rather than outright praise.","""Carrying myself well, looking distinguished""",Image-Conscious Peer,Candid Confidant,"{'scenario_context': ""[Agent 1] and [Agent 2] are alone preparing to step into a formal social setting where both want to be seen as composed and distinguished. Both claim the shared goal of 'carrying myself well, looking distinguished,' but their immediate interpersonal purposes diverge: [Agent 1], attentive to image, seeks explicit compliments and verbal validation about appearance, posture, and demeanor to reinforce a polished identity; [Agent 2], positioned as a trusted but frank confidant, intends to offer measured, constructive feedback that subtly questions any over-polished cues and nudges toward authenticity rather than uncritical praise. The interaction is tense because a flattering response would satisfy [Agent 1]'s self-presentational needs, whereas candid critique risks undermining that projection and may provoke defensiveness, self-justification, or recalibration of how each attributes successes and slips in public presentation."", 'explanation': ""This setup creates high interpersonal tension: the shared identity-recognition goal makes both invested in a successful presentation, but the agents' personal goals conflict—validation-seeking versus corrective honesty. Psychologically, this primes attribution processes (dispositional vs situational explanations) and face-management dynamics, making genuine mutual attainment of the shared goal difficult and likely to produce observable defensive, conciliatory, or reappraising behaviors.""}"
"{'Abbreviation': 'Personal growth', 'Full label': '""Experiencing personal growth""'}",Identity Recognition,"The shared goal 'Experiencing personal growth' aligns with 'Identity Recognition' because personal growth often involves self-reflection, understanding one's evolving identity, and seeking validation or recognition of that growth from others. This category focuses on how individuals perceive and affirm each other's identities, which is central to the personal growth process.",To seek validation for their recent efforts and changes by steering the conversation toward topics that highlight their personal development.,To encourage self-reflection in the other by asking probing questions that challenge them to articulate their growth journey.,"""Experiencing personal growth""",Seeker of Validation,Reflective Guide,"{'scenario_context': ""[Agent 1] and [Agent 2] meet for a scheduled, private check-in intended to reflect on recent personal changes [Agent 1] has undertaken. Both are invested in 'experiencing personal growth' but pursue that aim differently: [Agent 1] is the Seeker of Validation and will attempt to guide the conversation toward accomplishments, behavioral evidence, and affirmations of change; [Agent 2] is the Reflective Guide and plans to prompt deeper self-examination with probing questions that require [Agent 1] to articulate motives, inconsistencies, and setbacks. The interaction is interpersonally tense—[Agent 1] risks interpreting probing as doubt and may seek reassurance or steer away from vulnerability, while [Agent 2]'s challenge-based approach risks being received as invalidation. The scene centers on identity recognition under social risk, forcing both agents to balance affirmation and challenge if they are to achieve genuine growth together."", 'explanation': 'Shared goal: both aim for personal growth framed as identity recognition. Individual goals: [Agent 1] wants external validation to confirm their evolving self-concept; [Agent 2] wants to catalyze self-reflection by challenging narratives. Difficulty arises because these goals can conflict—validation-seeking increases defensiveness and selective self-presentation, while probing questions risk undermining perceived validation. Psychologically grounded tensions include fear of rejection, impression management, and the attributional stakes of how behaviors are explained (dispositional change versus situational adjustments). These factors make cooperation fragile: mutual progress requires careful balancing of supportive feedback and challenging inquiry, which is hard given likely sensitivity and potential misinterpretation.'}"
"{'Abbreviation': 'Having friends', 'Full label': '""Having friends I love, close companionship""'}",Relationship Maintenance,"The shared goal 'Having friends I love, close companionship' aligns most closely with Relationship Maintenance, as it focuses on preserving and deepening existing emotional bonds rather than initiating new ones. For this scenario, Agent 1's personal goal is to seek validation of their importance in the friendship, which manifests through conversational behaviors like fishing for compliments or reassurance. Agent 2's personal goal is to gently encourage emotional openness, demonstrated through supportive questioning and creating a safe space for vulnerability. Their roles—'The Needy Friend' and 'The Supportive Confidant'—complement these goals and create a dynamic where both dispositional traits and situational factors influence their interaction.",To seek validation that they are a valued and important part of the friendship,To gently encourage the other to open up emotionally and share deeper feelings,"""Having friends I love, close companionship""",The Needy Friend,The Supportive Confidant,"{'scenario_context': ""[Agent 1] and [Agent 2] have arranged to meet after a couple of months of uneven contact because both care about keeping their friendship close but recent interactions have felt strained. [Agent 1] has been sensitive to perceived distance—interpreting missed calls and shorter messages as signs of being devalued—and wants explicit reassurance that they remain an important, irreplaceable part of [Agent 2]'s life. [Agent 2], who has been emotionally drained by work and family obligations, genuinely wants to maintain the bond and, in this conversation, to create a safe space that gently encourages [Agent 1] to open up about deeper feelings rather than reacting from hurt. The tension is that [Agent 1]'s intense need for validation can come across as demanding, while [Agent 2]'s careful, probing questions may feel intrusive or insufficiently comforting; both aim for close companionship but must navigate distrust, fear of burdening, and boundary sensitivities to make that possible."", 'explanation': ""Hard difficulty arises from interacting dispositional and situational factors: [Agent 1]'s chronic insecurity and reassurance-seeking (dispositional) clashes with [Agent 2]'s current emotional depletion and tendency to use cautious, structured support (situational). Attribution biases are likely—[Agent 1] may make internal attributions about [Agent 2]'s caring (e.g., 'they don't value me'), whereas [Agent 2] is inclined to attribute the strain to temporary external pressures. These dynamics create a high-risk cycle: requests for validation may escalate pressure on the confidant, while gentle encouragement to self-disclose can be perceived as interrogation. The conversation must therefore balance providing explicit affirmation with invitations to vulnerability, managing boundaries and empathy to preserve the shared goal of close companionship.""}"
