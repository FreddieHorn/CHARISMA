"['Tyler Durden', 'Walter White']","{'Abbreviation': 'Firm values', 'Full label': '""Having firm values""'}",Identity Recognition,"The shared goal 'Having firm values' is best aligned with the 'Identity Recognition' category, as it involves agents asserting, understanding, and negotiating their core beliefs and principles. This creates a scenario where dispositional traits and situational factors interact, as one agent (the Advocate) is motivated to persuade and align the other with their values, while the second agent (the Questioner) is driven to critically examine and understand the depth and consistency of those same values. Their personal goals are distinct, measurable through conversational behavior (e.g., persuasive language vs. probing questions), and reflect a fundamental social intention to influence and understand, respectively.","""Having firm values""",To persuade the other agent to adopt their value system as the correct one.,To critically examine the other agent's values for consistency and depth.,Moral Advocate,Skeptical Inquirer,"{'scenario_context': ""[Agent 1] and [Agent 2] agree to have a focused, respectful conversation about what it means to 'have firm values.' Both want a clearer, more stable sense of identity through articulated principles: [Agent 1] adopts the role of Moral Advocate, presenting a coherent value system and aiming to persuade [Agent 2] that those principles should be endorsed; [Agent 2] adopts the role of Skeptical Inquirer, gently probing for consistency, edge cases, and motivations to evaluate the depth of [Agent 1]'s commitments. The interaction is collaborative and oriented toward mutual clarification rather than confrontation."", 'explanation': ""This setup makes the shared goal (achieving firm values) explicit while specifying each agent's personal aims—persuasion versus critical examination—so their behaviors will naturally reflect dispositional and situational influences.

[Agent 2], who previously tried to calm the situation, now meets with [Agent 1] to address the criticism away from the group.

This category focuses on preserving existing social bonds, routines, and established patterns of interaction, which directly supports the desire for stability and adherence to familiar ways of living. The personal goals are designed to reflect different approaches to maintaining stability: one agent seeks to reinforce existing patterns through validation, while the other aims to protect stability by cautiously managing potential disruptions.

This aligns most closely with 'Identity Recognition' as the core social goal category, as religious traditions often serve to affirm and validate one's place within a faith community and to be seen by others as a genuine member. The personal goals are designed to reflect distinct motivations within this context: one agent seeks to establish their authentic belonging through the ritual, while the other aims to gauge and affirm the first agent's commitment, creating a dynamic where social validation is implicitly negotiated through their interaction.","""Engaging in religious traditions""",To be perceived by the other as a genuine and committed member of the faith through their participation.,To assess the authenticity and depth of the other's faith based on their engagement with the tradition.,New Devotee,Established Elder,"{'scenario_context': ""In the small congregation's weekly ritual, [Agent 1], a recent convert, sits beside [Agent 2], an established elder who often guides newcomers. Both are preparing to perform a series of familiar ceremonial actions together; [Agent 1] follows instructions carefully, occasionally hesitates, and makes subtle efforts to demonstrate respect and attentiveness.
