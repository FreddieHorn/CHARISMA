Earlier, a quip by [Agent 2] in the group chat about performative nodding was read by [Agent 1] as a jab, and [Agent 2] read [Agent 1]’s slow replies as aloof, so both enter with uneasy expectations about each other’s motives.

Each expects the other’s behavior to reflect fixed traits (aloofness vs attention‑seeking), increasing the chance they’ll misread situational moves (minimal encouragers, mirroring, self‑disclosure) as inauthentic. Time pressure, public evaluation, and a forced midstream role switch heighten interruption risk and anxiety, making empathic reflection feel patronizing and similarity bids feel contrived.

Both agents have overlapping but tense histories: in a prior sprint, [Agent 1]\'s upbeat reframes were later criticized as glossing over feasibility, while [Agent 2]\'s rigorous questioning was experienced by partners as shutting ideas down.
