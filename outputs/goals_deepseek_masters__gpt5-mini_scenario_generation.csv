"{'Abbreviation': 'Aspirations', 'Full label': '""Achieving my aspirations""'}",Relationship Building,"The shared goal 'Achieving my aspirations' is fundamentally about personal growth and ambition, which often requires external support, guidance, and validation. The 'Relationship Building' category best aligns with this, as achieving aspirations frequently involves forming new connections to gain mentorship, encouragement, or collaborative opportunities. This context sets the stage for two distinct interpersonal dynamics: one agent seeking guidance and validation, and the other offering support and direction.",To seek and secure the other's validation of their plan as a viable path to success.,To guide the other toward a more pragmatic and structured approach to their aspirations.,"""Achieving my aspirations""",Aspiring Visionary,Pragmatic Mentor,"{'scenario_context': ""[Agent 1] (the Aspiring Visionary) and [Agent 2] (the Pragmatic Mentor) are preparing for a focused one-on-one check-in about [Agent 1]'s plan to advance a personal aspiration. The interaction is framed around the shared goal of 'achieving my aspirations' with an emphasis on building and maintaining a supportive relationship: [Agent 1] wants affirmation that their big-picture plan is a viable path to success and seeks the other's validation; [Agent 2] aims to preserve the relationship while steering [Agent 1] toward a more pragmatic, structured set of steps and milestones. Both expect a cooperative exchange to evaluate the plan, clarify assumptions, and align emotional support with actionable guidance."", 'explanation': ""This setup highlights complementary motives—[Agent 1]'s need for validation and [Agent 2]'s tendency to offer practical structure—within a relationship-building context. Because both agents want the same overall outcome (advancement of [Agent 1]'s aspirations) and anticipate a cooperative check-in, the scenario is low-tension and attainable (Easy). It creates clear opportunities to observe how validation-seeking and pragmatic advising interact: attributional judgments (is success due to vision or manageable steps?) and influence attempts (endorsement vs. reframing) will naturally emerge during the conversation.""}"
"{'Abbreviation': 'Life’s limitations', 'Full label': '""Accepting life’s limitations""'}",Relationship Building,"The shared goal 'Accepting life’s limitations' aligns most closely with Relationship Building. This category focuses on developing mutual understanding and emotional support, which is essential when confronting life's inevitable constraints. The scenario involves two agents with complementary approaches: one seeks validation for their perspective while the other aims to provide pragmatic reframing. Their personal goals are designed to be interactionally measurable through conversational behavior—Agent 1's goal manifests through seeking reassurance and emotional alignment, while Agent 2's goal appears through practical guidance and perspective-shifting. The roles ('Seeker of Validation' and 'Pragmatic Guide') reflect their distinct social positions and motivations within this context.",To seek emotional validation and reassurance from the other agent that their feelings about life's limitations are understood and accepted.,To encourage the other agent to reframe their perspective on limitations by highlighting potential opportunities or alternative viewpoints.,"""Accepting life’s limitations""",Seeker of Validation,Pragmatic Guide,"{'scenario_context': '[Agent 1] has recently been confronting a clear limitation in their life (e.g., a health diagnosis, a career plateau, or caregiving responsibilities) and has asked [Agent 2] for a candid, one-on-one conversation. [Agent 1] wants emotional validation—reassurance that their frustration, sadness, or grief about these limits is understandable and accepted—while [Agent 2], cast as a pragmatic guide, intends to listen empathetically but also to gently encourage reframing by pointing out realistic opportunities, alternative perspectives, and ways to live meaningfully within constraints. Both aim to arrive at mutual acceptance of life’s limitations and to strengthen their relationship through trust and understanding; the interaction is cooperative, low-conflict, and focused on emotional support paired with practical reappraisal.', 'explanation': 'The scenario positions [Agent 1] as seeking validation for internal feelings (dispositional focus) and [Agent 2] as offering situational reframing and pragmatic guidance. Their shared goal—accepting life’s limitations—aligns both agents toward relationship-building, making the exchange cooperative and attainable. This setup creates a clear dynamic for observing how empathic acceptance and cognitive reframing interact in shaping attributions and relational outcomes.'}"
"{'Abbreviation': 'Being likeable', 'Full label': '""Being likeable, making friends, drawing others near""'}",Relationship Building,"The shared goal 'Being likeable, making friends, drawing others near' aligns most closely with the 'Relationship Building' category, as it focuses on initiating and developing positive social connections. For Agent 1, the personal goal is to project warmth and approachability through supportive language, aiming to create an immediate sense of rapport. For Agent 2, the personal goal is to seek validation and reassurance through self-disclosure, aiming to test the other's acceptance and build trust.

[Agent 2], mildly anxious but motivated to connect, plans to share a personal detail cautiously and monitor [Agent 1]’s verbal and nonverbal responses for signs of acceptance. Both aim to be liked and to establish a friendly rapport, so the forthcoming interaction will center on supportive feedback, gentle self-disclosure, and mutual signals of interest.', 'explanation': 'This scene aligns the shared goal (being likable, making friends) with [Agent 1]’s role (Affirmative Connector) and [Agent 2]’s role (Cautious Sharer).
