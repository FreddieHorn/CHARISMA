"{'Abbreviation': 'Educational degree', 'Full label': '""Obtaining an advanced educational degree""'}",Cooperation,"We selected 'Cooperation' as the social goal category because obtaining an advanced educational degree often requires collaborative efforts, mutual support, and shared resources. The agents' personal goals and roles should reflect how they contribute to and benefit from this cooperative dynamic while maintaining their individual motivations.",To leverage peer expertise to improve their own research methodology and academic writing skills.,To gain recognition as a supportive collaborator while advancing their own thesis work through shared insights.,"""Obtaining an advanced educational degree""","The Novice Researcher (e.g., a first-year graduate student seeking guidance)","The Mentor-like Peer (e.g., an experienced senior student open to collaboration)","{'scenario_context': 'Agent 1, a first-year graduate student with limited research experience, is eager to improve their academic writing and research methodology skills. They have identified Agent 2, a senior student known for their strong analytical skills and collaborative nature, as a potential mentor-like figure. Agent 1 approaches Agent 2 during a departmental research symposium with the hope of establishing a cooperative relationship. While Agent 2 is open to collaboration and enjoys mentoring, they are also under pressure to complete their own thesis and seek recognition for their expertise. The interaction takes place in a busy university library study room, where both agents are working on their respective projects. The shared goal of obtaining an advanced degree binds them, but their individual goals introduce a medium level of tension—Agent 1 risks appearing overly dependent, while Agent 2 must balance their time and resources to avoid compromising their own progress.'}"
"{'Abbreviation': 'Ethical', 'Full label': '""Being an ethical person""'}",Conflict Resolution,We selected 'Conflict Resolution' as the social goal category because it involves navigating interpersonal tensions while striving to uphold ethical standards. This scenario allows us to explore how different personality traits influence approaches to resolving conflicts ethically.,"To advocate for fairness and justice in resolving the conflict, ensuring all parties are treated equitably.","To restore harmony and maintain positive relationships, prioritizing empathy and understanding over strict fairness.","""Being an ethical person""",Ethics Advocate,Mediator,"{'scenario_context': ""At a university, a dispute arises between two student groups over the allocation of funding for extracurricular activities. The student council, tasked with resolving the issue, assigns [Agent 1], an Ethics Advocate, and [Agent 2], a Mediator, to find a solution. Both agents agree on the shared goal of 'being an ethical person' but approach the conflict differently. [Agent 1] aims to advocate for fairness and justice, ensuring that funding is distributed equitably based on transparent criteria. [Agent 2], however, prioritizes restoring harmony among the groups, focusing on empathetic discussions and compromise to maintain positive relationships. The tension arises from balancing the need for fairness with the desire to preserve group cohesion, making the resolution challenging but not insurmountable. The agents must navigate these differing priorities while working toward a mutually acceptable outcome.""}"
"{'Abbreviation': 'Avoiding rejection', 'Full label': '""Avoiding rejection by others""'}",Relationship Maintenance,We selected 'Relationship Maintenance' as the social goal category because it aligns well with the shared goal of 'Avoiding rejection by others'. Maintaining relationships often involves behaviors aimed at preserving social bonds and avoiding exclusion. The two agents will have complementary personal goals and roles that reflect their unique perspectives while working toward the shared goal.,To appear likable and non-threatening to avoid being excluded from the group.,To demonstrate loyalty and reliability to ensure continued acceptance by others.,"""Avoiding rejection by others""",The Pleaser (focused on social harmony and avoiding conflict),The Dependable (focused on proving their value to the group),"{'scenario_context': 'The two agents are members of a tight-knit volunteer group at a local community center. The group is planning a major fundraising event, and tensions are high as everyone wants to contribute meaningfully while also ensuring their place within the group is secure. [Agent 1], as The Pleaser, is overly concerned with being perceived as agreeable and avoiding any potential conflict that might lead to exclusion. [Agent 2], as The Dependable, is eager to prove their reliability by taking on significant responsibilities, but this may inadvertently pressure others, including [Agent 1]. The shared goal of avoiding rejection by others is at risk as their approaches subtly clash—[Agent 1] might over-accommodate at the cost of authenticity, while [Agent 2] might overcommit, creating unsustainable expectations. The medium difficulty arises from balancing these dynamics without triggering insecurities in either agent.'}"
