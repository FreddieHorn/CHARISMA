"['Fallon Carrington', 'Hannibal Lecter']","{'Abbreviation': 'Mature romantic', 'Full label': '""Having a mature romantic relationship""'}",Relationship Maintenance,"A mature romantic relationship centers on relationship maintenance: balancing empathic understanding with clear self-advocacy. Agent 1 aims to validate and accurately read the partner’s internal states (curbing dispositional blame), while Agent 2 aims to assert needs without accusation (shifting talk toward situational framing and collaboration). These intentions are observable in conversational tone, framing, and responses, aligning with attribution theory.","""Having a mature romantic relationship""","Demonstrate active understanding by paraphrasing the partner’s concerns and explicitly naming the feelings they express while maintaining a calm, non-defensive tone.","Assert personal needs and boundaries using direct, non-accusatory language that invites joint problem-solving rather than attributing fault.",Emotional Validator,Boundary Setter,"{'scenario_context': '[Agent 1] and [Agent 2] sit down for a scheduled relationship check-in the night before they must decide whether to sign a joint lease. Tension is high after [Agent 2] saw a photo timestamp showing [Agent 1] having one-on-one drinks with a coworker right after saying they were stuck late at work. [Agent 2] has been feeling chronically dismissed when plans change last-minute and when phones are used during their limited time together; they intend to set boundaries around advance notice for schedule changes, clarity about one-on-one socializing, and no phones during meals. [Agent 1], stressed by a new project and worried about being cast as dishonest or uncaring, has committed to a non-defensive stance: paraphrasing [Agent 2]’s concerns and explicitly naming the emotions behind them. Both want a mature, stable partnership but hold competing interpretations of the same behaviors—disrespect and secrecy versus workload norms and spontaneity—and must agree on concrete expectations under time pressure. Previous conversations have devolved into [Agent 2] escalating when feeling unsafe and [Agent 1] minimizing with situational explanations, so both are trying to break this pattern while deciding on rules that feel fair to both.', 'explanation': 'The scene creates attributional ambiguity around the same behavior (staying out and phone use): [Agent 2] tends toward dispositional attributions (you don’t care/you hide things), while [Agent 1] favors situational attributions (work demands/social pressure). High stakes (imminent lease), perceived trust violations, and prior demand–withdraw cycles make the interaction hard. The goals are complementary but challenging: [Agent 1] must validate without defending, countering the self-serving bias; [Agent 2] must assert needs with non-accusatory language, reducing characterological blame and inviting joint problem-solving. Success requires reframing attributions and negotiating boundaries under emotional load, directly engaging relationship maintenance dynamics.'}","[{""agent"": ""Fallon Carrington"", ""response"": ""Hannibal, I know this isn't easy for either of us, but I want you to know I'm fully present and listening. I can see how hurt you've been by that photo and my changing schedule. It sounds like you've been feeling dismissed and unimportant when plans shift without proper notice, and that my one-on-one drinks with a colleague made you question my honesty. Am I understanding that correctly?"", ""behavioral_code"": ""Empathize"", ""explanation"": ""I selected 'Empathize' because I'm actively validating Hannibal's feelings by paraphrasing his concerns and explicitly naming the emotions behind them ('hurt,' 'dismissed,' 'unimportant'), which aligns with my personal goal of demonstrating active understanding while maintaining a calm, non-defensive tone as the Emotional Validator.""}, {""agent"": ""Hannibal Lecter"", ""response"": ""How perceptive of you to notice my discomfort, Fallon. Though I must correct your assumption - it's not about questioning your honesty, but rather the elegance of your deception. When plans shift without notice, it feels less like spontaneity and more like being served leftovers when one expected a carefully prepared meal. The photo merely confirmed what the pattern suggested: your priorities are... fluid."", ""behavioral_code"": ""Passive-aggressive"", ""explanation"": ""I selected 'Passive-aggressive' because Hannibal would use indirect resistance and sophisticated language to express dissatisfaction while maintaining a veneer of civility, perfectly aligning with his manipulative and intellectually superior nature.""}, {""agent"": ""Fallon Carrington"", ""response"": ""I hear you saying that it feels like you're getting leftovers instead of the full attention you deserve when plans change unexpectedly. That must make you feel undervalued and like our time together isn't being prioritized properly."", ""behavioral_code"": ""Empathize"", ""explanation"": ""I selected 'Empathize' because I'm actively validating Hannibal's feelings by paraphrasing his metaphor and explicitly naming the emotions behind his experience, which aligns with my personal goal of demonstrating understanding while maintaining a non-defensive stance.""}, {""agent"": ""Hannibal Lecter"", ""response"": ""Precisely. Though I would refine your culinary metaphor - it's not merely about prioritization, but about the fundamental respect shown through consistency. When one promises a symphony and delivers elevator music, it speaks to character. Tell me, Fallon - what rules shall we establish to ensure our partnership maintains its... flavor?"", ""behavioral_code"": ""None"", ""explanation"": ""Hannibal uses sophisticated metaphors and psychological insight rather than direct empathy or politeness, maintaining his characteristic intellectual superiority while steering toward boundary-setting without overt conflict.""}, {""agent"": ""Fallon Carrington"", ""response"": ""I understand you need consistency and clear expectations to feel respected in this relationship. How about we agree on a 24-hour notice for any schedule changes unless it's a genuine emergency? And during our meals together, phones stay away - that time is just for us."", ""behavioral_code"": ""Repair Attempt"", ""explanation"": ""I selected Repair Attempt because I'm offering concrete solutions to address Hannibal's concerns about consistency and respect, demonstrating my commitment to restoring harmony while maintaining my non-defensive stance.""}, {""agent"": ""Hannibal Lecter"", ""response"": ""Adequate, though I'd prefer 48 hours for proper planning - emergencies require definition, naturally. And phones during meals are indeed vulgar intrusions. But we haven't addressed the more delicate matter: one-on-one social engagements. Shall we discuss transparency there as well, or would you prefer to keep that course... unseasoned?"", ""behavioral_code"": ""Politeness"", ""explanation"": ""Using respectful phrasing while maintaining directness about unmet needs, consistent with Hannibal's precise and controlled communication style that masks underlying intensity with civility.""}, {""agent"": ""Fallon Carrington"", ""response"": ""I hear you asking for clarity about my social engagements outside our relationship.

I prefer knowing as plans arise - it allows for proper appreciation of your social palette. And I shall extend the same courtesy, of course. Trust, like a fine wine, should be decanted carefully."", ""behavioral_code"": ""Politeness"", ""explanation"": ""I selected 'Politeness' because Hannibal is maintaining respectful phrasing while asserting his preference for immediate transparency, which aligns with his sophisticated but direct communication style and his personal goal of setting clear boundaries.""}, {""agent"": ""Fallon Carrington"", ""response"": ""I understand you want immediate disclosure about social plans as they happen rather than weekly updates. That makes sense - it would give you the transparency needed to feel secure in our relationship. I can commit to that, and I appreciate you offering the same courtesy in return."", ""behavioral_code"": ""Empathize"", ""explanation"": ""I selected 'Empathize' because I'm validating Hannibal's need for immediate transparency and acknowledging how this approach would help him feel more secure, which aligns with my role as Emotional Validator and demonstrates active understanding of his concerns.""}, {""agent"": ""Hannibal Lecter"", ""response"": ""Excellent.
