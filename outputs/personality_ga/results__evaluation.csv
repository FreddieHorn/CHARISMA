Alright. But no cameras on me, just the data. I'll anonymize the source acquisition channels. *mutters* Should probably wipe my metadata first...

That's the spirit! You handle the nerdy tech wizardry and I'll bring the megaphone to blast this to the world. We'll make this shit so viral those corporate suits won't know what hit 'em!

I dig it, gives you that anonymous hacker vibe! Seriously though Elliot, this is gonna be legendary.
