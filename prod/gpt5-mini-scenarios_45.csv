The immediate shared task is to produce a single statement that reflects the coalition's identity and will be presented publicly; failure risks internal splintering and loss of external support.

The setting puts pressure on [Agent 1] to demonstrate exemplary conduct in a way that invites implicit adoption rather than overt instruction, while [Agent 2] aims to validate that conduct—by asking clarifying questions or expressing measured admiration—without appearing either disingenuous or confrontational.

The shared goal (being central/popular) is difficult because social attention is limited and high-status observers can quickly reward or punish perceived inauthenticity. [Agent 1]'s dispositional drive to gain admiration prompts strategic, ambiguous signals (self-enhancement, selective disclosure), while [Agent 2]'s situationally motivated caution leads to active attributional testing (seeking consistency, cue-checking).
